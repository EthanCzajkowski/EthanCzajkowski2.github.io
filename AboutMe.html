<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>My Name Is Ethan Joseph Czajkowski</h2>
<div id="mytext">
<p>
I was born March 5th 2003 and developed a love of anime after I initially began encountering it
on Netflix when I was around 10 years old.<br><br> My first anime was Sword Art Online and ever since
anime has been the main form of media I consumed, eventually I started reading Manga as well
and, in my thirst for more content, even Fanfiction.<br><br> The reason this site came to be is because of an assignment
from my web development class in college, I was told to make my own website, whatever I wanted it to be.<br><br>
The only thing I could think of was my love for anime, so I decided my site would be a way for me
to share what I love with others
